# Word-Clock

Forked from e5h/Word-Clock.  Currently the only change is to letter layouts.  Additional features planned:

* DST correction, likely be switch or push button.
* Combining the code here with the custom word clock controller I'm working on.
* Possible addition of a letter- and word-mapping tool. Likely using an array to store the overall view of the face.


This repository is dedicated for the code and documentation of my word clock, which at the moment can be found at:
